### CODEOWNERS

A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in gitignore files, with some exceptions. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the standard @username or @org/team-name format. You can also refer to a user by an email address that has been added to their GitHub account, for example user@example.com.

If any line in your CODEOWNERS file contains invalid syntax, the file will not be detected and will not be used to request reviews.
